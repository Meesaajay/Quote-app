Quote App
 
Welcome to the Quote App â€” a small and fun project that shows you random motivational quotes. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's a great little practice project if you're just starting to learn web development.

Whatâ€™s in the Project?

Here are the three main files you'll be working with:

- `index.html` â€“ The main page layout (kind of like the structure or bones of your app).
- `style.css` â€“ This file handles how everything looks â€” colors, fonts, spacing, and more.
- `script.js` â€“ This is where the magic happens! It handles how quotes change when you click the button.

 What Does the App Do?

- As soon as the page loads, you'll see a motivational quote.
- Click the "Show Quote" button to see a new one each time.
- The quotes come from a small list written in the JavaScript file.
- Youâ€™ll also notice a smooth animation whenever the quote changes â€” just a nice touch to make it feel more polished!


What Youâ€™ll Learn

If youâ€™re new to coding, this project helps you practice:

- How HTML is used to build the structure of a page
- How CSS makes the page look stylish and adds animations
- How JavaScript lets you interact with the page (like making the button work)
- Using arrays and random numbers in JavaScript
- Working with the DOM using `getElementById()` and event listeners


## ðŸ™Œ Why This Project Exists

This was made as a fun, beginner-friendly practice project. Itâ€™s simple, but it helps you understand how websites actually work â€” and itâ€™s satisfying to build something that looks good and works smoothly!
