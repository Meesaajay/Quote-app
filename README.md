Quote App
 
Welcome to the Quote App â€” a small and fun project that shows you random motivational quotes. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's a great little practice project if you're just starting to learn web development.

Whatâ€™s in the Project?

Here are the three main files you'll be working with:

- `index.html` â€“ The main page layout (kind of like the structure or bones of your app).
- `style.css` â€“ This file handles how everything looks â€” colors, fonts, spacing, and more.
- `script.js` â€“ This is where the magic happens! It handles how quotes change when you click the button.

This was made as a fun, beginner-friendly practice project. Itâ€™s simple, but it helps you understand how websites actually work â€” and itâ€™s satisfying to build something that looks good and works smoothly!
